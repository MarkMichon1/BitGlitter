BitGlitter is an easy to desktop app that lets you embed data inside ordinary images or video.  Store and
host files wherever images and videos can be hosted.  The carrier for data is the  'blocks' within the
frames and not the file itself, and there are various measures to read imperfect distorted frames. What this
means for you is streams are resistant to compression and distortion, and aren't broken by things such as
format changes, metadata changes, etc. BitGlitter gives you a unique way to make your data more portable.

Barcodes and QR codes are everywhere. They embed binary data (0's and 1's) in them, symbolized as black and
white. While they are pretty constrained in the real world, using them for digital transfer removes many of
those limits. What if you could have multiple barcodes (frames), that if read sequentially could have the
capacity of many thousands of individual ones? What if we added colors to the barcodes, so a given barcode
could have 2x, 6x, 24x the capacity? What if we greatly increased the size of the frames to lets say the
size of a standard 1080p video, so the frames once again increase their capacity by a couple orders of
magnitude.

Combine all of these together, and you're able to move serious amounts of data. This is BitGlitter.
