        <h3>âš¡ Storing and transferring files using high-performance animated barcodes</h3>
        <img src="../../../assets/gif/demo.gif" class="img-fluid img-center" alt="responsive image">
        <p>BitGlitter is an easy to desktop app that lets you embed data inside ordinary images or video.  Store and
            host files wherever images and videos can be hosted.  The carrier for data is the  'blocks' within the
            frames and not the file itself, and there are various measures to read imperfect distorted frames. What this
            means for you is streams are resistant to compression and distortion, and aren't broken by things such as
            format changes, metadata changes, etc. BitGlitter gives you a unique way to make your data more portable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Barcodes and QR codes are everywhere. They embed binary data (0's and 1's) in them, symbolized as black and
            white. While they are pretty constrained in the real world, using them for digital transfer removes many of
            those limits. What if you could have multiple barcodes (frames), that if read sequentially could have the
            capacity of many thousands of individual ones? What if we added colors to the barcodes, so a given barcode
            could have 2x, 6x, 24x the capacity? What if we greatly increased the size of the frames to lets say the
            size of a standard 1080p video, so the frames once again increase their capacity by a couple orders of
            magnitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            Combine all of these together, and you're able to move serious amounts of data. This is BitGlitter.

        <h3><strong>Write: Turning files into BitGlitter streams</strong></h3>
        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Regarding output size...</h4>
            <p>
                Its currently recommended sticking with the default config settings for write and not send payloads
                larger than several tens of megabytes (MB).  Codecs used in video rendering still need to be optimized,
                and files created can be quite large.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5><strong>Step 1/5: File/Folder Select</strong></h5>
        <p>
            BitGlitter lets you choose between sending a single file or a folder.  Simply choose which one, and then
            select it with the button directly below.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Step 2/5: Stream Configuration</strong></h5>
        <p>
            <strong>Render Mode</strong> is what lets you toggle between outputting a single MP4 BitGlitter stream
            (recommended) or a bunch of images.  This gives you more choices as to where you can host your files.  Images
            are more or less the same as the frames used in the videos, but with some added necessary headers.  If you
            can, its easier to use videos, being its just one file.  <strong>Important:</strong>  Rendering images will
            very likely generate hundreds/thousands of images if you're using default config settings (can be dramatically
            shrunk using custom values).  Be sure to create a folder somewhere and set that as your write path in settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enabling <strong>Compression</strong> packages and shrinks your payload prior to rendering it in frames,
            resulting in less frames needing to be rendered, and being overall more efficient.  It is strongly recommended
            to not change this.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Stream Name</strong> is the name given to it, and will be seen by others reading the stream.  You
            can look at it like the name of a torrent.  You can use up to 150 ASCII characters.  This is required.  Aside
            from supplying the file(s) to write and the title, this is all you technically need to do.  Everything else
            has default values, so you can use this app starting out without needing to know exactly how everything works.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Stream Description</strong> is an optional field if you want to add more information about the stream.
            You can use all ASCII characters, and there is no length limit.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Step 3/5: Render Configuration</strong></h5>
        <p>
            This is the main window where you control how the frames will render.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Palette Selection</strong> is where you choose which palette you'll have in your stream.  You can
            get much more information about the palettes using the Palette window accessible on the main screen.
            The default palette used is a great middle ground choice for both performance and file
            integrity.  We'll explain this much more in detail below.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Pixel Width</strong> is how many pixels across each block (square displayed) will be.  Larger blocks
            will be easier to read, but less efficient for data transmission.  Smaller blocks are the exact opposite,
            harder to read but more efficient.  In lossless applications you can make them very small (as small as one
            pixel across), giving extreme increases in efficiency (data per frame).  It all comes down what your use case
            is.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Block Height</strong> and <strong>Block Width</strong> are the dimensions in which the frame will be
            constructed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Frames Per Second</strong> is (no surprise) how many frames will be in a given second of video.
            Generally, the more the better, but be mindful of what is supported on platforms if you intend to host it
            somewhere.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Step 4/5: Encryption Configuration</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Optionally, you can choose to encrypt your stream, giving only people with your key access to the files.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Encryption Key</strong> is where you'll type the password in.  Long, random strings of characters
            are strong passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>File Masking</strong> will, if encrypting the stream, hide the stream manifest (displaying its contents,
            files, folders, file sizes, etc).  It will only be visible (as well as the data able to be extracted) once
            the correct key is supplied.
        </p>
        <p>
            (Advanced) <strong>Scrypt N, R, and P</strong> are parameters used when hashing your password.  Basically,
            you can control how costly it is for a computer to brute-force your password.  This is not at all something
            you need to touch if you don't know what it is (or don't care); the values are set to strong defaults, and
            this only exists so those more familiar with cryptography can fine tune how strong they want it to be.
            <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-scrypt-parameters/" target="_blank">This page</a> does a great job
            explaining this more in detail.
        </p>
        <p>
            All values must be positive integers.  Parameter <code class="code">N</code> takes a value as 2**N (must be
            a power of 2 in other words), <code class="code">R</code> and <code class="code">P</code> accept values as-is.
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> if using non-default values for this, the person(s) reading the stream must know
            what they are to input them during the read process.  If this isn't done, the stream cannot be decrypted,
            even with the right password!
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Step 5/5: Rendering</strong></h5>
        <p>
            This is where the magic happens.  After packaging your file(s) they are rendered into a video or images.
            Cancelling will abort the render.  When complete, the <code class="code">SHA-256</code> hash of the stream
            will display.  This is the unique fingerprint of the file(s) encoded in the stream, and serves as an ID
            for the stream itself.  This can be used by readers to verify the stream is what they think it is.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Potential Errors</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Things may break, and if so, the app will let you know with a display message.  An text file with the 'state'
            of the app will be written in your write path, where your rendered files will output (configurable in the
            settings window, more on that below).  It would help a lot to send this to us on Discord, or to create an "issues"
            on Github so we can look into it and fix it.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Verifying if a file is a BitGlitter stream</strong></h3>
        <p>
            If you have a file that you aren't sure can be read, or whether it is a BitGlitter stream or not, theres an
            easy way to check.  On the main window, go to <strong>File -> Verify Stream.</strong>.  After selecting the
            file, the app will test to see if it can find and read some calibration headers, as well as read the
            initializer header present at the start of all image frames and at the beginning of each video file.  No
            data about the stream is saved if the test passes, this is only to check if it can be read at all.
        </p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <h3><strong>Read: Turning BitGlitter streams back into files</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Supported video formats:</strong> .avi, .flv, .mov, .mp4, .wmv</p>
        <p><strong>Supported image formats:</strong> .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp</p>
        <h5><strong>Step 1/4: Encoded File Select</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Start by selecting your video or image files you'd like to decode.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Step 2/4: Read Configuration</strong></h5>
        <p>These options give you a bit more control over security, and behavior of the app.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Stop at Metadata Load</strong> pauses the read operation once it reaches and decodes the metadata
            header.  A prompt will appear on the screen, displaying all of the data it has collected from the stream.
            Enable this if you're not completely sure you trust the sender or wish to verify its contents before
            continuing.  If you cancel, the stream's SHA-256 (its ID) will be placed on a 'blacklist' and future frames
            from it will be ignored.  These blacklisted streams can always be removed in the "Saved Streams" window.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Unpackage Files</strong> controls whether you want to unpackage all available files at the end of
            the read cycle.  BitGlitter will extract as many files from a stream as possible if there are any corrupted
            frames.  Disabling this will prevent this entirely.  You can unpackage them later in the "Saved Streams"
            window.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Auto-Delete Finished Stream Data</strong> will remove all stream data and database files once the
            stream is 100% complete.  It usually makes sense to keep this enabled.  If disabled, while the temporary data
            from the frames will be removed, the metadata and state data about the read itself will remain.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Step 3/4: Decryption</strong></h5>
        <p>
            If you know the stream is encrypted, this is where you can enter the decryption key and other values.  If
            the stream is encrypted when you didn't think it was, or you got any of the values wrong- don't worry, you
            can change them in the "Saved Streams" window and try again.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Scrypt N, R, and P</strong> shouldn't be touched unless you know that the sender has changed the
            default values.  Be advised- if you change these values when the stream used the default ones, the decryption
            key will not work!
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Step 4/4: Reading</strong></h5>
        <p>This is where the magic happens, and your files get extracted from the stream.</p>
        <h5><strong>Metadata Prompt</strong></h5>
        <p>
            If you have "Stop at Metadata Load" enabled in Step 2, this prompt may come up.  Choose to either continue
            decoding the stream if everything looks good to you, or cancel it.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Saved Reads</strong></h3>
        <p>
            This is where you can view and interact with your saved reads, as well as important information about them.

        <h5>TBA</h5>

    <div>
        <h3><strong>Palettes</strong></h3>
        <p>
            This is in reference to the palette window, accessible in the main menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            Palettes are the color sets used in frames to send data.  There is a nice range of palettes included with the
            app; some are purely functional to maximize file integrity or performance, others are purely aesthetic.  You
            can also create your very own color sets to use in your BitGlitter streams, with whatever colors you want!
            But more on that in a moment.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Default Palettes</strong></h5>
        <p>
            These are included palettes that are optimized for performance, file integrity, or a combination of both.
            There was not much thought put into their aesthetics, but rather doing a good job at what they are intended
            to do.  It is recommended to stick with these until you understand what makes a palette "good" for data transmission,
            and yes, we will teach you.  Default palettes will always have the word "default" in their name, and will
            be permanently locked in the app (cannot be deleted).
        </p>
        <h5><strong>More About Palettes</strong></h5>
        <p>
            If you click a palette in the selection window on the left side of the palette screen, the display on the right
            will tell you a variety of different attributes about it.  We'll go over those here.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Bit Length</strong> is how many bits of binary data (the building block for all files/data on computers)
            fit into each "block," or colorful square.  There are 8 bits in a byte.  The higher it is, the more compact
            a stream will be, fitting into less blocks and frames overall.  You generally want to have this as high as you
            can, with the medium that will host the rendered file in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Color Distance Score</strong> is the "distance" between colors in the set from each other.  Think of
            it as a margin of error if there is any corruption or distortion to the images; the closer the colors are in terms
            of value (say the color red and a very slightly different color of red), the less it will take to corrupt
            the frame.  The greater the difference between colors (like black and white), the harder it is for one to be
            mistaken for the other when reading.  This is calculated by viewing the RGB channels for each color as XYZ
            coordinates in 3D space, and finding the shortest distance that exists between the colors.
        </p>
        <p>
            So as you can see, you want to maximize both bit length AND color distance.  But its impossible to have both;
            they are like different extremes on a sliding scale.  Each end has its own benefit.  This is exactly why there
            is a default palette (6 Bit Default) that gives you a great compromise between the two; holding a good amount
            of data, while at the same time resistant for most use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Color Set</strong> is simply the RGB set of colors that make up the palette.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Palette ID</strong> is the internal ID used within BitGlitter to identify and work with the palette.
            This is more for development purposes, you don't need to worry about this.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Palette Share Code</strong> is a code you can share with others so too can render using custom palettes
            saved on BitGlitter.  Please note- when someone reads a stream using a custom palette, they automatically
            "learn" the palette.  So this is for if you want to share the palette without someone needing to read a stream
            using it.  Use this code with the "import palette" button on the top left of the palette window.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Created On</strong> is the time this palette was created.  The time dynamically adjusts to your time zone.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Included with BitGlitter</strong> is if this particular palette came shipped with the app.  BitGlitter
            includes both some default palettes to use and a few dozen custom ones designed by various artists to play around
            with, and see what's possible with the app.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Using Custom Palettes</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Custom palettes are any non-official color sets able to be used in streams.  As said directly above, the app
            comes with a few.  Aside from them being "custom," they perform exactly as a normal palette would when reading
            and writing.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Importing Palettes</strong></p>
        <p>
            If you have a share code given to you by someone else, all you have to do is click the blue import button on the top
            left of the palette window, and paste the code in there.  Clicking import will add it to your list of available
            palettes to use.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Creating Palettes</strong></p>
        <p>
            Creating your own custom palettes is an easy, straight-forward process.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Palette Name</strong> is the main identifier for the palette, and what will be displayed on the app.
            There is a maximum limit of 50 characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Palette Description</strong> is an optional field you can use to add a bit more extra information
            about it if you'd like.  There is a maximum limit of 100 characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Color Set</strong> is the list of colors in RGB format that will make up the palette.  There's a few
            guidelines to follow when adding colors:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Must follow this format with brackets, commas, and spaces:  <code class="code">(0,0,0),
                    (100,100,100)</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Must have 3 channels (red, green, blue) for each color, and all be integers between 0 and 255.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cannot have two identical colors in the same color set.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The amount of total colors must be a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cannot have more than 256 colors in a palette.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            To maximize durability against file corruption, its recommended making your colors as varied as possible.
            The color distance score updates each time you update the text box for it.

        <h3><strong>Settings</strong></h3>
        <p>There is a handful of settings you configure BitGlitter with:</p>
        <p><strong>Write Path</strong> is where your rendered files will save to.</p>
        <p><strong>Read Path</strong> is where your files extracted from BitGlitter streams will save to.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Bad Frame Strikes</strong> is something used during reading to 'break you out' of severely corrupted
            streams.  Reading and decoding each frame is a relatively CPU expensive task, and when done over thousands or
            tens of thousands of frames, takes a considerable amount of time.  This functionality will abort a read if
            1) its enabled, and 2) if the count of bad frames exceeds a certain amount.  This feature exists to save you
            time in case the majority of frames are severely corrupted, and you don't want to go through the stream.
            Disabling it will have the app go through every frame, regardless of how many past frames were corrupt and
            unreadable.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Maximum CPU Cores</strong> lets you set how much of your CPU you wish to dedicate to writing and reading
            streams.  The work is pretty CPU intensive, and BitGlitter leverages as many CPU cores as possible to speed

            <strong>Enable Statistics</strong> toggles whether read and write data is added to the statistics window (explained
            in the next section below this).  Disabling it will clear all existing statistics.

            <strong>Output Stream Name in Write</strong> means the rendered files during write will have the stream name
            as the file.  If disabled, the <code class="code">SHA-256</code> hash of the stream will be used as the
            filename instead.

        <p>
            <strong>Display Advanced Read Data</strong> shows extra information about stream reads not necessarily practical
            for end users to see.  While its mostly meant for development and debugging purposes, enable it if you're
            curious to see a bit more on how data is handled underneath the hood.

        <h3><strong>Statistics</strong></h3>
        <p>
            This contains some interesting statistics to view your usage with BitGlitter.  They get updated at the
            end of each read or write cycle.  Pressing <strong>Clear</strong> resets all values back to zero.  You can
            toggle this functionality in the settings window.

            I hope the guide gave you a better understanding of BitGlitter and how it works.  It was a lot of work
            putting this all together, but its a great feeling to finally release this to the world.

            By this point, you may see the many directions this technology can go in, and the impact it can make in the
            world of file sharing, and transferring data/information.  There are quite a few directions it can evolve
            towards, but I can't do it alone.  If you're comfortable with Python or Javascript, you can define which
            direction we go next with this.  Check out the
            <a href="https://github.com/MarkMichon1/BitGlitter" target="_blank">Github page</a> for the repo if you
            haven't already, and here is our <a href="https://discord.gg/t9uv2pZ" target="_blank">Discord server</a>.
