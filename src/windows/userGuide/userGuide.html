        <h3>⚡ Storing and transferring files using high-performance animated barcodes</h3>
        <img src="../../../assets/gif/demo.gif" class="img-fluid img-center" alt="responsive image">
        <p>BitGlitter is an easy to desktop app that lets you embed data inside ordinary images or video.  Store and
            host files wherever images and videos can be hosted.  The carrier for data is the  'blocks' within the
            frames and not the file itself, and there are various measures to read imperfect distorted frames. What this
            means for you is streams are resistant to compression and distortion, and aren't broken by things such as
            format changes, metadata changes, etc. BitGlitter gives you a unique way to make your data more portable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Barcodes and QR codes are everywhere. They embed binary data (0's and 1's) in them, symbolized as black and
            white. While they are pretty constrained in the real world, using them for digital transfer removes many of
            those limits. What if you could have multiple barcodes (frames), that if read sequentially could have the
            capacity of many thousands of individual ones? What if we added colors to the barcodes, so a given barcode
            could have 2x, 6x, 24x the capacity? What if we greatly increased the size of the frames to lets say the
            size of a standard 1080p video, so the frames once again increase their capacity by a couple orders of
            magnitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            Combine all of these together, and you're able to move serious amounts of data. This is BitGlitter.

        <p>
            This is nothing but some interesting statistics to view your usage with BitGlitter.  They get updated at the
            end of each read or write cycle.  Pressing <strong>Clear</strong> resets all values back to zero.

            I hope the guide gave you a better understanding of BitGlitter and how it works.  It was a lot of work
            putting this all together, but its a great feeling to finally release this to the world.

            By this point, you may see the many directions this technology can go in, and the impact it can make in the
            world of file sharing, and transferring data/information.  There are quite a few directions it can evolve
            towards, but I can't do it alone.  If you're comfortable with Python or Javascript, you can define which
            direction we go next with this.  Check out the
            <a href="https://github.com/MarkMichon1/BitGlitter" target="_blank">Github page</a> for the repo if you
            haven't already, and here is our <a href="https://discord.gg/t9uv2pZ" target="_blank">Discord server</a>.
